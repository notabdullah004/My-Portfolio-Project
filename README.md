# Responsive Homepage — Odin Project

This is my implementation of the **Homepage** project from The Odin Project’s *Advanced HTML & CSS* curriculum.

## 📄 Project Overview

In this challenge, you build a responsive homepage — similar to a portfolio landing page — following a given design in three breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile). The goal is to practice layout techniques, media queries, semantic HTML, and responsive styling.  
You are free to choose fonts, colors, and images (rather than using the exact assets from the design), but your layout and responsive behavior should match the intended design.

🧪 Testing / Responsive Checks

Resize your browser or use dev tools to simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile widths

Check that typography scales or wraps gracefully

Confirm images / icons maintain aspect ratio / alignment

Test navigation/menu behavior at smaller widths

Cross-browser checks: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

🚧 Known Limitations / Future Improvements

 Enhance with CSS transitions / hover effects

 Add light / dark theme toggle

 Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
